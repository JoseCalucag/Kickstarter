# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This is a project that looks at Kickstarter-funded theatre data between 2014-2016; most notably US successful and failed plays, UK research and various charted data. Based upon my analysis, we still see that the the theatre is still getting successfully pledged and well supported. Albeit we do see that there are lulls over the course of the year, we are definitely seeing a lot of succesful pledges happen at the beginning of festival season; starting in May until the end of summer.

And as you dig deeper, we are seeing that a lot of successful pledged shows are fairly modest. We see that most of are backers are willing not to shell out big funds, but are still willing to help support the arts as most successful kickstarters range around the 3K-5K range and we have seen failed kickstarters at the 10K region. To break it down further, when looking at 5 plays that were staged in Edinborough, two one man shows not only were successful Kickstarters, 'Cutting Off Kate Bush' crushed their goal by 172% while 'The Hithchiker's Guide to the Family' had well over 100 backers.

So, an intriguing recommendation that I hypothesized is to maybe have a showcase of one-man shows or maybe even a short-billed festival to see if that can generate enough buzz and revenue for the arts and the theatre in the UK, then branch out into select cities in the US to see if it can work 'across the pond'.
